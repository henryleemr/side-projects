**Sentiment Analysis:**
* run basic_sentiment_analysis.py to analyse the "mood" (sentiment) of a piece of text by assingning a score 
* the higher the score, the more "postive" the sentiment of the text is 
* said text is entered at "main"

**Note:**
* reccomend running using "Spyder" IDE via anaconda instead of VS Code
