**Camera Calibration:**
* The primary motivation of the code repository is to obtain the Optimum KMatrix of a predefined camera. 
* This is done by running RunOptimiseKMatrix.m from “Optimise”. 
* In order to change the characteristics of the camera, camera parameters can be altered from BuildCamera.m in order to obtain the corresponding optimized KMatrix. 

**Methods used:**
* RANSAC
* Cholesky method for optimisation
