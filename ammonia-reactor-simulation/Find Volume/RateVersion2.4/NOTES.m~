Changes from before:BuildReactor:Set initial ammonia flow to zeroChanged number of discs, N = 50 for speed Mass error decreases with increasing total inlet flow rate (almost linear relation) -at FEED = 2000kmol/s, MassError = 5.3325% but XTotN2 drops to 8.2335%Mass error decreases with decreasing temperature Mass error decreases with decreasing pressureMass error decreases with decreasing volumeMass error is almost constant wrt CSAAll results do not vary significantly with number of discs, may increase accuracy slightly when N is changedfrom 100 to 300In NH3Disc:-Added PercentageMassError = 100*(OutletMass - InletMass)/InletMass-Added plots for N2 and H2 flow -Added plots for NH3, N2 and H2 concentration (not isntantaneous concentration though, just against the final flow rate)-Commented out FOUTTOTALNH3 (redundant)-Removed DISCNH3OUT (redundant)-Moved the storing of RATE alongside the DISCNH3 etc. -RATE(1) = 0; %assume first instance of rate is 0-OutletMass = FH2*2 + (FN2)*14 + FAR*40 + DISCNH3IN(N+1)*17; %NOTE: mass flow in kg/h from + DISCNH3IN(N)*17 TO + DISCNH3IN(N+1)*17NOTE: The mass error decreases along a series of PFRs,hence only the first PFR would have a max mass flow percentage error.FOR:%% Reactor operating conditions:p.P = 200; %atmp.T = 683; %kelvin of first stagep.X = 0.30; % Total conversion of first stage%% Temkin-Pyzhev:% Variablesp.FEED = 100; %Total feed stream in kmol/hANDp.V = 0.20; %total volume of reactor, in m^3p.NDiscs = 50; %number of divisions of disc of reactorp.dV = p.V/p.NDiscs; %volume of a disc in reactorp.s1 = 1;p.Alpha = 0.5; %range from 0.5-0.75PercentageMassError =     9.7570%XTotN2 = 15.0650%Flow NH3 final = 7.4572 kmol/h
