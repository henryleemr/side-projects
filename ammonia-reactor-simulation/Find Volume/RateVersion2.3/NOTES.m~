Changes from before:BuildReactor:Changed top.V = 0.39; %total volume of reactor, in m^3p.NDiscs = 100; %number of divisions of disc of reactorp.dV = p.V/p.NDiscs; %volume of a disc in reactorp.s1 = 1;p.Alpha = 0.5; %range from 0.5-0.75NOTE: -THIS GIVES A N2 CONVERSION OF XTotN2 = 30.0586! Corresponding to our 3D PLOT!! -However, the mass flow output = 635.9331 kg/h, which is still not equal to the Initialmass flow rate of 532.7kg/h, but much closer than before nowIn NH3Disc:Added syms notation for FNH3OUT to bypass fsolve using vpasolve insteadPlotted the rate as well (red line)mazz_balance:Instead of outputing a function, it now gives the value of FNH3OUT itself
