Changes from before:RPT3D:Changed the range of P and Ts Changed the rate equation to the one using k1 and k2 TemkinVariables:Changed the value of the constants for ko and E for the previous old rate equation, butis now redundant because we are now using the new rate equation FOR X= 0.05:RANGE P = 1:1:400;T = 400:1:1000;surf(T,P,r);zlim([-1e2 2.5e4])  IS GOODChanged for X = 30% limits on graph
