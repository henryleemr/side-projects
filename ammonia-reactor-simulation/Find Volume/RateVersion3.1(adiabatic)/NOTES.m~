Changes from before:BuildReactor:In NH3Disc:-Introduced global T to NH3Disc and dTdL, added the matrix for storing and plotting vs time (results dont change much)-Added plot for conversion along length of PFR-Changed "Molar concentration" in plot to "Mole fraction"-Changed error in mass balance percentage to *28 for N2 and solved the mass balance error! YES! Also solved for theerror in BuildReactor!NOTE:Adding in fugacity coefficients decreases the accuracy of the outlet mass flow and increases the X slightly (1), and increases the NH3 output slightly dTdL:-Removed TemkinVariables and TemkinPyzhev calculated updated T-Experimented by implementing the equation for heat from "3YP Notes 7", the plot looks less like the rate now,and is more expected curve and taper at end though it is less linear than expected. NOTE:Not sure if the NewT = T - ... or NewT = T0- ...
