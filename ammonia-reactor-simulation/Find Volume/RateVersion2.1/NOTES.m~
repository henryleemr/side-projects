Changes from before:BuildReactor:Introduced the Yi feed concentrationsChanged the volume of reactor from 10m^3 to 5m^3 and Area to fiddle with conversionChanged p.m = p.FH2*2 + (p.FN2+p.FN2O)*14 + p.FAR*40 + p.FNH3*17; %NOTE: mass flow in kg/hRemoved FN2O, it is redundantIn NH3Disc:Changed the rate equation to the one using k1 and k2 Changed the linspace of length to be accurately the length along the PFR instead ofpercentage length Chnged the units of plot to kmol/hAdded  massflow = FH2*2 + (FN2 +FN20)*14 + FAR*40 + DISCNH3IN(N)*17 %NOTE: mass flow in kg/h**Corrected%PlotLength = linspace(0,V/Area,length(DISCNH3IN)); => NOT CUMULATIVE!plot (Length,(DISCNH3IN))xlabel('Length along PFR, m')ylabel('NH3 flow kmol/h')In mass_balance:Changed the fugacities to partial pressures by commenting out fugacity coefficients
