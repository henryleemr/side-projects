**Design Objectives:**
The aim of this project is to calculate the design parameters of the reactor that would produce the minimum flow rate required downstream of the plant at the ammonia storage subsystem. These design parameters are operating temperature, pressure, input material flow rates, concentrations, and dimensions of reactor beds. The said design parameters will determine the resulting performance of the entire ammonia synthesis subsystem, which will be compared to the design goals as seen below.

To find the minimum volume of the ammonia reactor that would minimise cost,  **V_L_A_3D.m** from **“RateVersion3.2(V_L_A_3D)”** is run to give a plot of the Volume vs Length vs cross-sectional-area of the pipe-shaped reactor. Reactor characteristics can be changed via BuildReactor.m

**Benchmarks:**
Output Ammonia Flow Rate:
4 00 kmol/h

**Ammonia Output Purity:**
≥ 99 %

**Single Pass Conversion:**
≥ 50 % 

**Overall Conversion:**
≥ 95 %
