Changes from before:-Corrected the value for phiN2 (too large) there was a typo of 3 instead of -3-Ka is almost always zero, except at T= 1, then it is at infinity, problem-Realised there is a negative value for the stoictable in the H2 mole frac-Tweak values of feeds in buildreactor so that the fractions are all positive -Obtain values that are more sensivle, though rate equation is still negative, maybe that is because of the poisoning of the catalysts perhaps due to the same ratio of inert Ar to NH3, and a very high H2/N2 ratio of 9 instead of 3-Noticed that the Cp value for N2 and H2 are very very negative, like 12x10^-12, as opposed to argon and NH3 that are 200 or 400-Overall CpMix is -3.409663176416711e+13-Corrected an ERROR? of the B,C,D values in calculation of heat capacities to be minus orders of magnitude-Though the overall CpMix is still negative, possibly because this simulates a cracker hence endothermic reaction?- Also moved the other P,T dependent variables like HR and k out from buildreactor into TemkinVariables
