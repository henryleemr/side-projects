Changes from before:Suggest changing FNH30 = 0, and model everything with respect to N2 instead of NH3In NH3Disc:added a term FN20 , and defined FN2 = FN20 initially changed XTOT to XTotNH3 and commented it out add XN2 as a parameter for conversion instead of NH3BuildReactor:Changed top.FEED = 70; %Total feed stream in kmol/h p.FH2 = 0.7425*p.FEED; %feed of species in kmol/h as % of FEEDp.FN2 = 0.2475*p.FEED;p.FNH3 = 0.001*p.FEED;p.FN2O = 0.0000000000000000001*p.FEED; %for X1= 0.5 50% conversion of N2, FN20 = p.FAR = 0.009*p.FEED;V from 1 to 100
