Changes from before:-changed of NH3Disc for X calculation from p.FEED into FNH30, converted to %Changed FNH30 = p.FNH3FNH3IN = FNH30-tweaked P(225 originally) and T (723 originally) values from buildreactor-Changed T to 212K (opposed to 723K) in buildreactor, achieved conversion X of close to 100%-Changed pfr volume in bui,dreactor from 3m^3 to 10m^3-When pfr volume v is 0.0000001 m^3, the conversion is 72% at T = 723KNeed to:Find a link between fugacity, f and activity alpha
